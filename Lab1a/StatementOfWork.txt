1. Purpose
This laboratory work intends to get you used to Java socket programming under the Unix environment. After the professor explains about the LAB-320's machine configuration, the Linux envorinment, and Java sockets, you are to complete and run a simple server programs with Java sockets.
2. Statement of Work
Complete a ~css434/lab1a/EchoSErver.java that receives an ASCII message from a telnet client nad simply echos it back to the client.
EchoServer.java: opens a ServerSocket at a given port and goes into the following loop: (1) wait for a new client connection, (2) read a byte message, (3) simply echo it back, and (4) close this client conneciton.
To compile your programs, type:
   css434@uw1-320-10:~/lab1a$ javac EchoServer.java
Run your server program first and thereafter telnet
   css434@uw1-320-10:~/lab1a$ java EchoServer port
   css434@uw1-320-11:~/lab1a$ telnet uw1-320-10 port

   css434@uw1-320-10:~/lab1a$ java EchoServer 12345

   css434@uw1-320-11:~/lab1a$ telnet uw1-320-10 12345
   Connected to uw1-320-10.
   Escape character is '^]'.
   Hi!
   Hi!

   Connection closed by foreign host.
   css434@uw1-320-11:~/lab1a$ 
Cut and paste the results into a file.
