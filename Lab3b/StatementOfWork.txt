1. Purpose
This laboratory work intends to let you understand how to code and run mobile agents, so that you can focus on your HW3's code design.

2. Statement of Work
Read program 3's specification carefully to understand how to run UWAgent.
Code a simple mobile agent, say MyAgent.java that migrates to uw1-320-10, thereafter uw1-320-11, and finally uw1-320-12 in this order as printing out "hop", "step", and "jump" at a respective site. Please note that you can choose any three different computing nodes other than uw1-320-10, 11, and 12.
